<h1>NLP-Persian-Poets</h1>
<h3>How to use</h3>
1. place your test file in /test_set (include persian poems) <br>
2. run main.py <br>

<h3>How it works</h3>
This code uses some train sets to learn the n-grams (n=1, 2). These train sets each include the poems from a specific poet. Then the code uses these n-grams in a back-off model to predict the test poems. It also provides some accuracy for the model.
